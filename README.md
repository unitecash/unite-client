# Unite.cash Client Implementation

The Unite protocol is a powerful, extensible, robust and censorship-resistant
social networking and content distribution system.

Unite-client is simply the first application to implement this protocol.
Unite-client relies on Bitcoin Cash and IPFS for attribution, content storage
and content delivery.

## Temporary Note

The project, protocol and repository are currently in the process of being
re-factored. Files will move around frequently, builds may fail and
dependencies may change often.

## Building and Running

You will need NodeJS and NPM in order to build the project.
The process should work on all operating systems that can run NPM.

You will also need to install yarn.

Clone the repository to a directory on your computer. Then run the
commands below:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Your browser will open and when you make changes to the code, the changes
should be live-reloaded in your browser. Compiler warnings and errors will
update in real-time in the console.

## Contributing

of what needs doing. Especially lacking are UX and graphic designers.
