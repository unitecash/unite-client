This is the code for my implementation on BCH.
It's not vary organized, and some stuff doesn't run correctly
but I figured I'd share what I have so far. WebTorrent integration
and embedded media coming vary soon!
Here's a link to some documentation, though it's not complete or
up-to-date as I constantly change things
